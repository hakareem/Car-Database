# Car-Database
 I have used HTML & CSS & Typescript to build this project. This was an Object Oriented Programme and I built it for as a way for me to solidify my technical abilities in Typescript.
 
 
# Learning Experience 
I have learnt so much throughout this project. I was able to grasp the concept of classes and I was able to use localStorage to save cars uploaded to the server. I had to use dom manuplation to change the document structure, style and content. 

# Areas for improvement
My portfolio can certainly be developed and improved further. I will do this by:

• Creating dropdown menu's<br>
• Refactoring the code to make it consice <br>
• Custom Web URL <br>
• Appealing Visual Design and Layout <br>
• Project Description <br>
